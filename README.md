# CleanData
The Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera project
I followed the instructions as they are in the project, unfortunatley my Git Hub killed the beautiful REadMe that I've written

Please note:
1. I assumed the files are inside the workind directory and they have been expanded. The refering to a file is the same as in 
the Windows system
2 I used only the X_train and X_test file( not the data in the folders)
3 I tried my best to give the cleares notes possible. I hope the code and the codebook are clear!
